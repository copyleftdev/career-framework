# Syncromatics Engineering Career Framework

## About Syncromatics

Syncromatics is a Software-as-a-Service and hardware integrator that makes products for transit agencies and operators. Simply, we help our customers _do_ transit and connect with their riders.

The whole Syncromatics team shares three core values:

* We deliver on our promises
* We solve problems
* We share knowledge

## About Syncromatics Engineering

The Syncromatics Engineering team is made of the people who define, design, and implement transit solutions. Within this team, there are two groups who work closely together: software and system integration.

We are an agile team. (In both the "agile" and "Agile" senses.) Iteration and delivery are key drivers for us. We are frequently exploring the edges of new technology looking for new and better ways to get things done.

We love our craft. We work on a range of problems whose solutions directly impact people's ability to move around. Finding new, creative, and efficient ways to increase people's mobility is exciting, as is finding new algorithms for predicting bus arrivals and designing ruggedized hardware. 

We love and support the engineering community. As much as is possible, we strive to make our software open source and available to others. Developing relationships alongside technology is important to us.



## About the career framework

We took a lot of inspiration from Buffer's [Engineering Career Paths Framework][eng-career-paths-fx]. (Thanks [Katie][katie-womersley]!) Particularly, Buffer's "focus on the journey, the growth and evolution that is a career" is exactly the focus we want to have for the Syncromatics Engineering team.
