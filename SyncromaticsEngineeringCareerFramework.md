# Syncromatics Engineering Career Framework

## About Syncromatics

Syncromatics is a Software-as-a-Service and hardware integrator that makes products for transit agencies and operators. Simply, we help our customers _do_ transit and connect with their riders.

The whole Syncromatics team shares three core values:

* We deliver on our promises
* We solve problems
* We share knowledge


## About Syncromatics Engineering

The Syncromatics Engineering team is made of the people who define, design, and implement transit solutions. Within this team, there are two groups who work closely together: software and system integration.

We are an agile team. (In both the "agile" and "Agile" senses.) Iteration and delivery are key drivers for us. We are frequently exploring the edges of new technology looking for new and better ways to get things done.

We love our craft. We work on a range of problems whose solutions directly impact people's ability to move around. Finding new, creative, and efficient ways to increase people's mobility is exciting, as is finding new algorithms for predicting bus arrivals and designing ruggedized hardware. 

We love and support the engineering community. As much as is possible, we strive to make our software open source and available to others. Developing relationships alongside technology is important to us.


## About the career framework

We took a lot of inspiration from Buffer's [Engineering Career Paths Framework][eng-career-paths-fx]. (Thanks [Katie][katie-womersley]!) Particularly, Buffer's "focus on the journey, the growth and evolution that is a career" is exactly the focus we want to have for the Syncromatics Engineering team.

We have built this career framework to have two dimensions: Title and Distinction. The title describes a person's scope of influence and ownership of their work. The distinction describes a person's domain of expertise.


### Titles

| Title | Scope of Influence           | Contributions  | Ownership |
| ------------- |-------------|------|---|
| Intern        | Themselves and their tasks. | $1 | No ownership responsibility yet: this person is learning and being actively developed by others.
| Associate      | Themselves and their tasks.      |   $5 | No ownership responsibility yet: this person is learning and being actively developed by others.
| Engineer       | Their project and their peers.    |    $10 | Co-owns an area with guidance & takes initiative (e.g fixes bugs unprompted)
| Senior Engineer | Whole team/product area | $50 | Has a consistent record of **very strong ownership** for their area, e.g. figuring out on-call schedules, establishing monitoring
| Principal Engineer | Multiple teams/projects | $100 | Exhibits ownership across the org - this person is a guardian of **Syncromatics**


### Distinctions

Distinctions are grouped into "paths" that describe a collection of broadly related distinctions.

#### Software Engineering path

People in the software engineering path are focused on designing and building software.

| Distinction | Domain expertise |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Platform | Design, architecture, and implementation of Software-as-a-Service technologies. Includes databases, data structures, algorithms, and microservices. |
| Product | Design, architecture, and implemention of user experience, including third-party developer experience. Includes focus on polish and reliability of the finished product. |
| Devices | Research, design, architecture, and integration of Internet-of-Things and embedded devices. Includes electrical engineering as needed. |
| DevOps | Hosting, reliability, monitoring, and alerting. Includes developer experience, continuous integration/delivery, and tooling. |
| Test | Testability, repeatability, quality assurance, and automation. Includes diagnosis and prevention. |

#### System Integration path

People in the system integration path are focused on integrating software and hardware and certifying its viability and reliability for use in the field.

| Distinction | Domain expertise |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Test | Testability, repeatability, and quality assurance. Emphasis on ensuring the software and hardware work together in harsh environments. |
| Research & Development | Research, design, manufacturing/OEM sourcing, and planning for field rollout. |
